							<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
						</header>
						<p>
							Hey, I'm Lev Polonsky and I'm a senior student at the University of Colorado Boulder pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science. I'm passionate about front-end software engineering, having industry experience in website and application design, and I'm always looking to expand my skillsets and learn something new.
						</p>

						<p>
							My industry experience consists of being a software engineering intern for Workday, where I was part of a team developing tools and interfaces using JavaScript and React. Coming into this project, I had very little experience with React, but I quickly got comfortable with it and now consider it one of my strongest skills. I was also able to further bolster these skills while working on my capstone project, during which I developed a mobile application alongside a small team and our partner company Curve10.
						</p>
						<p>
							Before my industry experiences, I worked as an assistant coach for various racket sports at Lifetime Activities, mainly badminton and table tennis. While not directly applicable to software engineering, I still gained valuable and transferrable skills about working as a team and explaining concepts effectively. An effective software engineer will have to discuss their work with non-technical people fairly frequently, so being able to describe technical projects in non-technical terms is an important skill that this experience helped me master.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm excited to take on a new project where I can both apply what I've already learned through my various experiences and develop new skills. You can reach out by pressing the button below!
