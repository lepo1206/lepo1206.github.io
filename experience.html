									<h2><strong>Workday Internship</strong></h2>
									<p>During the summer of 2023, I worked as a Software Developement Engineering intern for Workday. I was part of a team developing front-end tools and features for a widely-used service provided by the company. Development was primarily done with React.js, which I hadn't had experience with beforehand, but throughout my internship I quickly became proficient with it and finished all my assigned tasks.</p>

									<h2><strong>FourWords Senior Capstone Project</strong></h2>
									<p>Throughout my college senior year, I was working alongside a small team and the company Curve10 to develop a short-form social media application. I was part of the front-end section of our team, and was tasked to develop the user interface of the application using React Native, as well as integrating database endpoints with JavaScript.</p>

									<h2><strong>MACLab Research Through CU SPUR</strong></h2>
									<p>During the summer of 2022, I worked alongside the MACLab research group on CU Boulder campus, as a part of CU SPUR (Summer Program for Undergraduate Research). I was part of a small team, where we created a website to showcase the lab's research on soft robotics, primarily using WordPress. I developed multiple interactive applets such as 3D model showcases and charts using JavaScript and various libraries, as well as designed the graphics used on the site's overlay.</p>
