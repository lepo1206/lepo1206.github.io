									<h2><strong>Videogame Speedrunning and Charity Volunteering</strong></h2>
									<p>Videogame speedrunning is the act of beating a game in its entirety as fast as possible, and it's one of my favorite pastimes. The skill-building and record-chasing aspect of it is probably the most popular portion, but what draws me the most is the problem solving required for strategy development and optimizations, as well as the community aspect of players coming together under a unified goal.</p>
									<hr />
									<p>Speedrunning communities often organize marathon events, where multiple runners showcase speedruns of different games while also raising money for charity. I've volunteered for many of these events over the years -- both online for grassroots events such as Archiethon and Multithon that raise thousands of dollars for their respective charities, and in-person for Awesome Games Done Quick 2024 which raised over $2.5 million for Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>

									<h2><strong>Coaching and Racket Sports</strong></h2>
									<p>During high school, I worked as an assistant coach for many racket sports, mainly badminton and table tennis. I've already been playing badminton for a couple years, and I was interested in gathering teaching skills, so this position really spoke to me. This experience helped me develop many invaluable soft skills, most notably being a strong leader and explaning concepts proficiently in layman's terms.</p>
